C# filter cross reference program
A small program I wrote for a companey I workfor to help us workshop staff cross reference filter numbers.

Program was orginaly written in 2013, since then ive lost the souce code. Decompiled with JetBrains dotpeek.
Recompiled code with Visualstudio 2015 and tested.
