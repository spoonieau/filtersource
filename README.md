# filtersource
C# filter cross reference program.
A small program I wrote for a company I work for to help us mechanic's cross reference filter numbers between different brands.

Program was orginaly written in 2013, since then I've lost the souce code. Decompiled with JetBrains dotpeek.
Recompiled code with Visualstudio 2015 and tested.

"database.dat" is just a txt, change extension to txt and edit at will.
